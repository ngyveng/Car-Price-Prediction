# Car-Price-Prediction
The automobile market in Cambodia has been growing rapidly in recent years, with an increasing number of car buyers seeking to purchase new and used cars. As a result, there has been a growing interest in determining the factors that influence car prices in Cambodia. In this study, we aim to explore the relationship between various car features and their impact on car prices in the Cambodian market.

To achieve this goal, we collected data on car prices and features from Khmer24, one of the largest online marketplaces for cars in Cambodia. We scraped the data and compiled a dataset containing information on various car features such as make, model, year, and transmission type, as well as their corresponding prices.

This project is to predict the price of a Car that we want to know 
It can help us easily know the specific price clearly
we used machine learning to predict the price and 

The models we used there are:

    - [1 Ridge Regression]
    
    - [2 Lasso Regression]
    
    - [3 Polynomial Regression]
    
    - [4 Ridge Polynomial Regression]
    
    - [5 Lasso Polynomial Regression]

    - [6 Linear Regression]
